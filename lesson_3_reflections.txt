When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you're working from more than one machine, or with other people.
Also, it serves as a backup in the cloud.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might be in the middle of working locally on the branch that gets
automatically pulled, which could interfere with what you're doing.
